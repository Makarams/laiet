// ─── Emoji vocabulary; world-grounded ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// These are our *translations* of their communication; like interpreting an
// alien language through familiar symbols. The guiding rule; each emoji maps to
// something a creature in this world can directly perceive, experience, or feel.
//
// Their world: apple trees, river water, grass, caves, mountains, rocks, mud,
// snow, fire (anomalous), day/night/dawn/dusk, seasons, bush/berries, cliffs,
// floods, biomes (arid heat, lush wet canopy, wetland, rocky cold), other
// creatures like themselves, death sites, and the unexplained caretaker.
//
// Rules:
// ; Human *artifacts* (tools, weapons, medicine, containers) are excluded.
// ; Felt bodily/emotional states are always valid; they have bodies and feelings.
// ; Abstract/universal symbols (⚠️ ❓ ❗ 🚫) are kept; logic needs no culture.
// ; Directional arrows (➡️ ⬆️ ⬇️) are spatial primitives, kept.
// ; We are translating, not transcribing; 🌈 is our word for "the thing that
//   appears in the sky after rain"; they don't call it a rainbow, but they see it.
